Short Description
A Document text Detection Generative Adversarial Nets (D2GAN) model is utilized
to perform the text localization task using SROIE data set.
D2GAN learns text-image features via ImageNet pre-trained VGG network in
adversarial manner and points out text locations. Note the images were scaled
in an arbitrary ratio and the detected coordinates were re-scaled into
original image space for the submission.
